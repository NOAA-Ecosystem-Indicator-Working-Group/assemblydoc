# Sea Surface Temperature

*This Indicator requires non-EIWG Contacts to update as of August 2021

Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is defined as the average temperature of the top few millimeters of the ocean. This temperature impacts the rate of all physical, chemical, and most biological processes occurring in the ocean. Sea Surface Temperature is globally monitored by sensors on satellites, buoys, ships, ocean reference stations, AUVs and other technologies. 

Sea Surface Temperature monitoring tells us how the ocean and atmosphere interact, as well as providing fundamental data on the global climate system. This information also aids us in weather prediction i.e. identifying the onset of El Niño and La Niña cycles - multiyear shifts in atmospheric pressure and wind speeds. These shifts affect ocean circulation, global weather patterns, and marine ecosystems. Sea Surface Temperature anomalies have been linked to shifting marine resources. With warming temperatures, we observe the poleward movements of fish and other species. Temperature extremes - both ocean heatwaves and cold spells, have been linked to coral bleaching as well as fishery and aquaculture mortality. We present annual average SST in all regions.

## Data
The sea surface temperature were accessed from (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oisst).  The data are plotted in degrees Celsius.

## Methods
SST Data are currently compiled and analyzed by Todd O'Brien from NMFS (todd.obrien@noaa.gov). More information about Todd's methods can be found here https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ZUwU-OGZN2hz_DXT2ai8pSnhtjMwcSY/edit

Presently, EIWG Member Veronica Lance is working with the NOAA CoastWatch team to produce dedicated monthly and annual means of the SST and Chl-a indicators at the LME scale for future NaMES use. More information about this can be found by emailing Veronica directly at Veronica.Lance@noaa.gov.
