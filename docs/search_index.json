[["chlorophyll-a.html", "1 Chlorophyll-a 1.1 Data and Methods", " 1 Chlorophyll-a *This Indicator requires non-EIWG Contacts to update as of August 2021 At the base of most marine food webs are microscopic plants, called phytoplankton - which also produce nearly half of the Earths oxygen. One way we measure the amount of phytoplankton in the ocean is via a pigment that phytoplankton produce - chlorophyll a. Using ocean color sensors on satellites, we can measure the amount of chlorophyll a in surface waters. Environmental and oceanographic factors continuously influence the abundance, composition, spatial distribution, and productivity of phytoplankton. Tracking the amount of phytoplankton in the ocean gives us the status of the base of the food web, and how much food is available for other animals to grow. Changes in the amount of phytoplankton in the ocean are part of the natural seasonal cycle, but can also indicate an ecosystems response to a major external disturbance. 1.1 Data and Methods Chlorophyll-a concentration values for this indicator were obtained using data from the European Spatial Agency (ESA) that is a validated, error-characterized, Essential Climate Variable (ECV) and climate data record (CDR) from satellite observations specifically developed for climate studies. The dataset (v5.0) is created by band shifting and bias-correcting SeaWiFS, MODIS, VIIRS and OLCI reflectance data to match MERIS ocean color wavelengths, merging the datasets and computing per-pixel uncertainty estimates.
