This website is designed to document the data sources and methods used to create the indicators displayed on the site. 0.1 Definition of Indicators Ecosystem indicators are quantitative and/or qualitative measures of key components of the ecosystem. Marine ecosystems provide food, jobs, security, well-being, and other services to millions of people across the U.S. Yet, marine ecosystems and the people that rely on them are facing increasingly complex challenges. Tracking the status and trends of ocean and coastal ecosystems is critically important to understand how these ecosystems are changing and identify potential issues. "],["chlorophyll-a.html", "1 Chlorophyll-a 1.1 Data and Methods", " 1 Chlorophyll-a *This Indicator requires non-EIWG Contacts to update as of August 2021 At the base of most marine food webs are microscopic plants, called phytoplankton - which also produce nearly half of the Earths oxygen. One way we measure the amount of phytoplankton in the ocean is via a pigment that phytoplankton produce - chlorophyll a. Using ocean color sensors on satellites, we can measure the amount of chlorophyll a in surface waters. Environmental and oceanographic factors continuously influence the abundance, composition, spatial distribution, and productivity of phytoplankton. Tracking the amount of phytoplankton in the ocean gives us the status of the base of the food web, and how much food is available for other animals to grow. Changes in the amount of phytoplankton in the ocean are part of the natural seasonal cycle, but can also indicate an ecosystems response to a major external disturbance. 1.1 Data and Methods Chlorophyll a data were obtained from the NOAA Fisheries Coastal &amp; Oceanic Plankton Ecology, Production, &amp; Observations Database (https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/copepod/). Measurements of ocean chlorophyll concentration were combined from both the SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua ocean color datasets and binned at 0.5 x 0.5 degree latitude-longitude boxes, annual averages for each year calculated from the average of all monthly means in that year, and the annual mean was calculated as the average of all annual means. Since no portal/product exists at present for the spatial and temporal needs of the NaMES website, data are compiled and analyzed by the COPEPOD database manager Todd OBrien.

By eating phytoplankton, and each other, zooplankton play a significant role in the transfer of materials and energy up the oceanic food web (e.g., fish, birds, marine mammals, humans.) Like phytoplankton, environmental and oceanographic factors continuously influence the abundance, composition and spatial distribution of zooplankton. These include the abundance and type of phytoplankton present in the water, as well as the waters temperature, salinity, oxygen, and pH. Zooplankton can rapidly react to changes in their environment. For this reason monitoring the status of zooplankton is essential for detecting changes in, and evaluating the status of ocean ecosystems. We present the annual average total biovolume of zooplankton in the Alaska, California Current, Gulf of Mexico and Northeast regions. 2.1 Data Zooplankton data for each region were obtained from the NOAA Fisheries Coastal &amp; Oceanic Plankton Ecology, Production, &amp; Observations Database, an integrated data set of quality-controlled, globally distributed plankton biomass and abundance data with common biomass units and served in a common electronic format with supporting documentation and access software which can be found at https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/copepod/about/about-copepod.html 2.2 Methods Data are compiled and analyzed by the COPEPOD database manager Todd OBrien.

The number and distribution of pelagic fish vary regionally, depending on multiple physical and ecological factors i.e. the availability of light, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, predation, abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton, etc. Small pelagics are known to exhibit boom and bust cycles of abundance in response to these conditions. Examples include anchovies, sardines, shad, menhaden and the fish that feed on them Small pelagic species are often important to fisheries and serve as forage for commercially and recreationally important fish, as well as other ecosystem species (e.g. seabirds and marine mammals). They are a critical part of marine food webs and important to monitor because so many other organisms depend on them. We present the annual total biomass of small pelagics/forage fish in the Alaska, California Current, and Northeast regions, as well as selected taxa in the Gulf of Mexico region. 4.1 Data 4.1.1 Alaska The Indicator for the NaMES Alaksa regions is the East Bering Sea Pelagic forager biomass (fish 1000t) which can be directly accessed from the AKIEA website here: https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/refm/reem/ecoweb/Index.php?ID=9 4.1.2 California Current 4.1.3 Gulf of Mexico The GoA IEA team produced a standardized menhaden biomass variable that is stored at https://github.com/mandykarnauskas/GoM-Ecosystem-Status-Report/blob/master/data/menhaden_abundance_index.csv As of this writing, the data had not been updated since 2020 and only go until 2015. 4.1.4 Northeast The NE IEA Program keeps all of their ESR data in an R package called ecodata.

Seabirds are attracted to fishing vessels and frequently get hooked or entangled in fishing gear, especially longline fisheries. This is a common threat to seabirds. Depending on the geographic region, fishermen in the United States often interact with albatross, cormorants, gannet, loons, pelicans, puffins, gulls, storm-petrels, shearwaters, terns, and many other species. We track seabirds because of their importance to marine food webs, but also as an indication of efficient fishing practices. We present estimates of seabird abundance in the Alaska, California Current, Gulf of Mexico and Northeast regions. 5.1 Data Data for Alaska, California Current, and the Gulf of Mexico were obtained from the regional NOAA Integrated Ecosystem Assessment Program teams that produce indicators and Ecosystem Status Report.

This indicator is compiled completely manually. The reports can be found at https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/psb/AMAPPS/. To calculate the indicator score for each year, one must go to the Seabirds -&gt; Results section of a corresponding years report and identify the paragraphs containing the Total seabirds seen, Total Seen in Zone, and the Nautical Miles Surveyed values. Then, those values for each cruise should be input into this google sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-g_d9eMWUchbm2xojlRG8Q_y7xzbtcyU1bHriW2ua4U/edit#gid=0). Finally, using the google sheet, the total number of seabirds observed for the entire year should be divided by the total nautical miles surveyed. That result produces the indicator score and should be manually input into the data file. "],["overfished-stocks.html", "6 Overfished Stocks 6.1 Data 6.2 Methods", " 6 Overfished Stocks Fish play an important role in marine ecosystems, supporting the ecological structure of many marine food webs. Caught by recreational and commercial fisheries, fish support significant parts of coastal economies, and can play an important cultural role in many regions. To understand the health of fish populations - as well as their abundance and distribution, we regularly assess fish stocks - stock assessments. Assessments let us know if a stock is experiencing overfishing or if it is overfished i.e. how much catch is sustainable while maintaining a healthy stock. And, if a stock becomes depleted, stock assessments can help determine what steps may be taken to rebuild it to sustainable levels. Understanding stock assessments helps measure how well were managing and recovering fish stocks over time. We present the number of overfished stocks by year in all regions. 6.1 Data Data are obtained from the NOAA Fisheries Fishery Stock Status website https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/population-assessments/fishery-stock-status-updates. Stocks that meet the criteria for overfished status are summed by year for each region.

After traveling to https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/population-assessments/fishery-stock-status-updates, identify the most up to date status report. The reports should be available in two formats - through a report and through a visual. The easiest way to compile the data are using the visual, which should be named Stocks on the Overfished and Overfishing Lists by Region. After opening the visual (example below), overfished stocks will be displayed by sqaures and sorted spatially by region. We are only counting the Overfished stocks - do not count stocks that are only on the Overfishing list. knitr::include_graphics(rep(&quot;overfished.png&quot;)) Figure 6.1: NOAA Fisheries 2020 Q4 Stock Status Map North Pacific corresponds to the Alaska Region, Pacific corresponds to the California Current, Western Pacific corresponds to Hawaii (but be sure not to count the pacific island specific complexes), and New England corresponds to North Atlantic.

This temperature impacts the rate of all physical, chemical, and most biological processes occurring in the ocean. Sea Surface Temperature is globally monitored by sensors on satellites, buoys, ships, ocean reference stations, AUVs and other technologies. Sea Surface Temperature monitoring tells us how the ocean and atmosphere interact, as well as providing fundamental data on the global climate system. This information also aids us in weather prediction i.e. identifying the onset of El Niño and La Niña cycles - multiyear shifts in atmospheric pressure and wind speeds. These shifts affect ocean circulation, global weather patterns, and marine ecosystems. Sea Surface Temperature anomalies have been linked to shifting marine resources. With warming temperatures, we observe the poleward movements of fish and other species. Temperature extremes - both ocean heatwaves and cold spells, have been linked to coral bleaching as well as fishery and aquaculture mortality.

Sea ice influences global climate by reflecting sunlight back into space. Because this solar energy is not absorbed into the ocean, temperatures nearer the poles remain cool. When sea ice melts, the surface area reflecting sunlight decreases, allowing more solar energy to be absorbed by the ocean, causing temperatures to rise. This creates a positive feedback loop. Warmer water temperatures delay ice growth in the autumn and winter, and the ice melts faster the following spring, exposing dark ocean waters for longer periods the following summer. Sea ice affects the movement of ocean waters. When sea ice forms, ocean salts are left behind. As the seawater gets saltier, its density increases, and it sinks. Surface water is pulled in to replace the sinking water, which in turn becomes cold and salty and sinks. This initiates deep-ocean currents driving the global ocean conveyor belt. Sea ice is an important element of the Arctic system. It provides an important habitat for biological activity, i.e. algae grows on the bottom of sea ice, forming the basis of the Arctic food web, and it plays a critical role in the life cycle of many marine mammals - seals and polar bears. Sea ice also serves a critical role in supporting Indigenous communities culture and survival.

These events have significant impacts to coastal economies and communities. The Billion Dollar Disaster indicator provides information on the frequency and the total estimated costs of major weather and climate events that occur in the United States. This indicator compiles the annual number of weather and climate-related disasters across seven event types. Events are included if they are estimated to cause more than one billion U.S. dollars in direct losses. The cost estimates of these events are adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and are based on costs documented in several Federal and private-sector databases. We present the total annual number of disaster events for all regions. 19.1 Data Billion dollar disaster event frequency data are taken from NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/). The number of disasters within each region were summed for every year of available data. Although the number is the count of unique disaster events within a region, the same disaster can impact multiple regions, meaning a sum across regions will overestimate the unique number of disasters. 19.2 Methods The Billion Dollar Event Frequency Data displayed on the website were compiled using the following code: PKG &lt;- c(&quot;foreign&quot;,&quot;stringr&quot;,&quot;data.table&quot;) for (p in PKG) { if(!require(p,character.only = TRUE)) { install.packages(p) require(p,character.only = TRUE)} } #states &lt;- c(&quot;AK&quot;,&quot;AL&quot;,&quot;AR&quot;,&quot;AZ&quot;,&quot;CA&quot;,&quot;CO&quot;,&quot;CT&quot;,&quot;DE&quot;,&quot;FL&quot;,&quot;GA&quot;,&quot;HI&quot;, # &quot;IA&quot;,&quot;ID&quot;,&quot;IL&quot;,&quot;IN&quot;,&quot;KS&quot;,&quot;KY&quot;,&quot;LA&quot;,&quot;MA&quot;,&quot;MD&quot;,&quot;ME&quot;,&quot;MI&quot;, # &quot;MN&quot;,&quot;MO&quot;,&quot;MS&quot;,&quot;MT&quot;,&quot;NC&quot;,&quot;ND&quot;,&quot;NE&quot;,&quot;NH&quot;,&quot;NJ&quot;,&quot;NM&quot;,&quot;NV&quot;, # &quot;NY&quot;,&quot;OH&quot;,&quot;OK&quot;,&quot;OR&quot;,&quot;PA&quot;,&quot;RI&quot;,&quot;SC&quot;,&quot;SD&quot;,&quot;TN&quot;,&quot;TX&quot;,&quot;UT&quot;, # &quot;VA&quot;,&quot;VT&quot;,&quot;WA&quot;,&quot;WI&quot;,&quot;WV&quot;,&quot;WY&quot;) states &lt;- c(&quot;AK&quot;,&quot;AL&quot;,&quot;CA&quot;,&quot;CT&quot;,&quot;DE&quot;,&quot;FL&quot;,&quot;GA&quot;,&quot;HI&quot;, &quot;LA&quot;,&quot;MA&quot;,&quot;MD&quot;,&quot;ME&quot;, &quot;MS&quot;,&quot;NC&quot;,&quot;NH&quot;,&quot;NJ&quot;, &quot;NY&quot;,&quot;OR&quot;,&quot;PA&quot;,&quot;RI&quot;,&quot;SC&quot;,&quot;TX&quot;, &quot;VA&quot;,&quot;WA&quot;,&quot;PR&quot;,&quot;VI&quot;) #Update Year in URL (2021) Billion_Storm &lt;- NULL for (x in states) { temp &lt;- tempfile() temp.connect &lt;- url(paste0(&quot;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events-&quot;,x,&quot;-1980-2021.csv&quot;, sep=&quot;&quot;)) temp &lt;- data.table(read.delim(temp.connect, header=TRUE,fill=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE,skip=1, sep=&quot;,&quot;)) temp$State &lt;- x Billion_Storm &lt;- rbind(Billion_Storm,temp) unlink(temp) rm(temp) } Billion_Storm$Begin.Date &lt;- as.character(Billion_Storm$Begin.Date) Billion_Storm$Begin.Year &lt;- substr(Billion_Storm$Begin.Date,1,4) Billion_Storm$Begin.Date &lt;- as.Date(Billion_Storm$Begin.Date,&quot;%Y %m %d&quot;) Billion_Storm$End.Date &lt;- as.character(Billion_Storm$End.Date) Billion_Storm$End.Year &lt;- substr(Billion_Storm$End.Date,1,4) Billion_Storm$End.Date &lt;- as.Date(Billion_Storm$End.Date,&quot;%Y %m %d&quot;) Gulf.of.Mexico &lt;- c(&quot;FL&quot;,&quot;AL&quot;,&quot;LA&quot;,&quot;MS&quot;,&quot;TX&quot;) Northeast &lt;- c(&quot;NC&quot;,&quot;VA&quot;,&quot;MD&quot;,&quot;DE&quot;,&quot;PA&quot;,&quot;NJ&quot;,&quot;NY&quot;,&quot;CT&quot;,&quot;RI&quot;, &quot;MA&quot;,&quot;NH&quot;,&quot;ME&quot;) Southeast &lt;- c(&quot;SC&quot;,&quot;GA&quot;,&quot;FL&quot;) California.Current &lt;- c(&quot;CA&quot;,&quot;OR&quot;,&quot;WA&quot;) Alaska&lt;- c(&quot;AK&quot;) Hawaii &lt;- c(&quot;HI&quot;) Caribbean &lt;- c(&quot;PR&quot;,&quot;VI&quot;) Storm_Freq &lt;- NULL for (x in c(&quot;Gulf.of.Mexico&quot;,&quot;Northeast&quot;,&quot;Southeast&quot;,&quot;California.Current&quot;,&quot;Alaska&quot;,&quot;Hawaii&quot;,&quot;Caribbean&quot;)) { TEMP &lt;- Billion_Storm[which(Billion_Storm$State%in%get(x)),] TEMP$Disaster &lt;- TEMP$Begin.Date &lt;- TEMP$End.Date &lt;- TEMP$Deaths &lt;- TEMP$State &lt;- TEMP$Begin.Year &lt;- NULL TEMP &lt;- unique(TEMP) colnames(TEMP)&lt;- c(&#39;Name&#39;,&#39;Frequency&#39;,&#39;End.Year&#39;) TEMP &lt;- aggregate(Frequency~End.Year, data=TEMP, FUN=length) TEMP$Region &lt;- x assign(paste0(x,&quot;_Data&quot;, sep=&quot;&quot;),TEMP) Storm_Freq &lt;- rbind(Storm_Freq,TEMP) rm(TEMP) } Storm_Freq_F &lt;- spread(Storm_Freq,Region,Frequency) write.csv(Storm_Freq_F,file=&quot;C:/Users/... your path.../Billion_Dollar_Storms_1980_Present.csv&quot;) rm(list=ls()) Gauge values counted manually.

"],["beach-closures.html", "20 Beach Closures 20.1 Data 20.2 Methods", " 20 Beach Closures Beach closures are the number of days when beach water and/or air quality is determined to be unsafe. Unsafe water and air quality may have significant impacts on human health, local economies, and the ecosystem. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) supports coastal states, counties and and tribes in monitoring beach water quality, and notifying the public when beaches must be closed. Beach water quality is determined by the concentration of bacteria in the water (either Enterococcus sp.or Escherichia coli). The information presented is from states, counties, and tribes that submit data to the EPA Beach Program reporting database. Not all US beach closures are captured in this database. We present a summary of known EPA Beach Program closure days by year for Alaska, California Current, Gulf of Mexico, Northeast, Hawaiian Islands, and the Southeast regions. 20.1 Data Data obtained from the EPA BEACON website have been provided to EPA by the coastal and Great Lakes states, tribes and territories that receive grants under the BEACH Act. Data was refined to closure, by state or territory, by year. Data compiled by states or territory and combined in regions defined as IEA regions except PI includes Guam and Marianas. Caribbean and South Atlantic data stand alone. Not all beaches in a state or territory are monitored through the EPA BEACH Act. Data for beaches monitored by state and local municipalities is not included. Changes in the number of beach closure days may be driven by changes in the number of beaches monitored under the BEACH Act versus by state and local municipalities.
