This website is designed to document the data sources and methods used to create the indicators displayed on the site. 0.1 Definition of Indicators Ecosystem indicators are quantitative and/or qualitative measures of key components of the ecosystem. Marine ecosystems provide food, jobs, security, well-being, and other services to millions of people across the U.S. Yet, marine ecosystems and the people that rely on them are facing increasingly complex challenges. Tracking the status and trends of ocean and coastal ecosystems is critically important to understand how these ecosystems are changing and identify potential issues.

The number and distribution of pelagic fish vary regionally, depending on multiple physical and ecological factors i.e. the availability of light, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, predation, abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton, etc. Small pelagics are known to exhibit boom and bust cycles of abundance in response to these conditions. Examples include anchovies, sardines, shad, menhaden and the fish that feed on them Small pelagic species are often important to fisheries and serve as forage for commercially and recreationally important fish, as well as other ecosystem species (e.g. seabirds and marine mammals). They are a critical part of marine food webs and important to monitor because so many other organisms depend on them. We present the annual total biomass of small pelagics/forage fish in the Alaska, California Current, and Northeast regions, as well as selected taxa in the Gulf of Mexico region. 4.1 Data 4.1.1 Alaska The Indicator for the NaMES Alaksa regions is the East Bering Sea Pelagic forager biomass (fish 1000t) which can be directly accessed from the AKIEA website here: https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/refm/reem/ecoweb/Index.php?ID=9 4.1.2 California Current 4.1.3 Gulf of Mexico The GoA IEA team produced a standardized menhaden biomass variable that is stored at https://github.com/mandykarnauskas/GoM-Ecosystem-Status-Report/blob/master/data/menhaden_abundance_index.csv As of this writing, the data had not been updated since 2020 and only go until 2015. 4.1.4 Northeast The NE IEA Program keeps all of their ESR data in an R package called ecodata.

"],["seabirds.html", "5 Seabirds 5.1 Data 5.2 Methods", " 5 Seabirds Seabirds are a vital part of marine ecosystems and valuable indicators of an ecosystems status. Seabirds are attracted to fishing vessels and frequently get hooked or entangled in fishing gear, especially longline fisheries. This is a common threat to seabirds. Depending on the geographic region, fishermen in the United States often interact with albatross, cormorants, gannet, loons, pelicans, puffins, gulls, storm-petrels, shearwaters, terns, and many other species. We track seabirds because of their importance to marine food webs, but also as an indication of efficient fishing practices. We present estimates of seabird abundance in the Alaska, California Current, Gulf of Mexico and Northeast regions. 5.1 Data Data for Alaska, California Current, and the Gulf of Mexico were obtained from the regional NOAA Integrated Ecosystem Assessment Program teams that produce indicators and Ecosystem Status Report. The links for each of the datasets can be found here: Alaska: https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/refm/reem/ecoweb/csv/table/Seabird.csv California Current: https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cciea_B_AS_DENS.csv?time,density_anomaly&amp;species_cohort=%22Cassins%20auklet%20(So%20CC,%20Spring)%22 Gulf of Mexico: https://github.com/mandykarnauskas/GoM-Ecosystem-Status-Report/blob/master/data/bird_standardized_abundancesFINAL.csv Seabird count and transect length data for the Northeast are extracted from the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS) annual reports. Counts are summed and divided by the sum of the transect length in nautical miles. For more information see https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/psb/AMAPPS/ 5.2 Methods 5.2.1 Alaska The Multivariate Breeding Index variable from the Eastern Bering Sea Ecosystem Status Report is currently used to represent seabirds for the NaMES Alaska Region. That data can be downloaded manually by clicking https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/refm/reem/ecoweb/csv/table/Seabird.csv. 5.2.2 California Current The Density Anomaly for Cassins Auklets in the Southern California Current (Spring) are used to represent the seabird indicator for the NaMES California Current region. Because this is an anomaly variable, the values for previous years will change every year - therefore, the entire dataset must be downloaded and replaced each year. The data can be downloaded manually by clicking https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/cciea_B_AS_DENS.csv?time,density_anomaly&amp;species_cohort=%22Cassins%20auklet%20(So%20CC,%20Spring)%22 5.2.3 Gulf of Mexico The GoA IEA team produces a standardized seabird relative abundance variable that is stored at https://github.com/mandykarnauskas/GoM-Ecosystem-Status-Report/blob/master/data/bird_standardized_abundancesFINAL.csv. As of this writing, the data had not been updated since 2020 and only go until 2015. 5.2.4 Northeast The northeast seabirds indicator is compiled using the AMAPPS Annual report each year. This indicator is compiled completely manually. The reports can be found at https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/psb/AMAPPS/. To calculate the indicator score for each year, one must go to the Seabirds -&gt; Results section of a corresponding years report and identify the paragraphs containing the Total seabirds seen, Total Seen in Zone, and the Nautical Miles Surveyed values. Then, those values for each cruise should be input into this google sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-g_d9eMWUchbm2xojlRG8Q_y7xzbtcyU1bHriW2ua4U/edit#gid=0). Finally, using the google sheet, the total number of seabirds observed for the entire year should be divided by the total nautical miles surveyed. That result produces the indicator score and should be manually input into the data file. "],["overfished-stocks.html", "6 Overfished Stocks 6.1 Data 6.2 Methods", " 6 Overfished Stocks Fish play an important role in marine ecosystems, supporting the ecological structure of many marine food webs. Caught by recreational and commercial fisheries, fish support significant parts of coastal economies, and can play an important cultural role in many regions. To understand the health of fish populations - as well as their abundance and distribution, we regularly assess fish stocks - stock assessments. Assessments let us know if a stock is experiencing overfishing or if it is overfished i.e. how much catch is sustainable while maintaining a healthy stock. And, if a stock becomes depleted, stock assessments can help determine what steps may be taken to rebuild it to sustainable levels. Understanding stock assessments helps measure how well were managing and recovering fish stocks over time. We present the number of overfished stocks by year in all regions. 6.1 Data Data are obtained from the NOAA Fisheries Fishery Stock Status website https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/population-assessments/fishery-stock-status-updates. Stocks that meet the criteria for overfished status are summed by year for each region. The status of stocks are available in report form and graphically. 6.2 Methods This indicator is compiled manually. After traveling to https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/population-assessments/fishery-stock-status-updates, identify the most up to date status report. The reports should be available in two formats - through a report and through a visual. The easiest way to compile the data are using the visual, which should be named Stocks on the Overfished and Overfishing Lists by Region. After opening the visual (example below), overfished stocks will be displayed by sqaures and sorted spatially by region. We are only counting the Overfished stocks - do not count stocks that are only on the Overfishing list. knitr::include_graphics(rep(&quot;overfished.png&quot;)) Figure 6.1: NOAA Fisheries 2020 Q4 Stock Status Map North Pacific corresponds to the Alaska Region, Pacific corresponds to the California Current, Western Pacific corresponds to Hawaii (but be sure not to count the pacific island specific complexes), and New England corresponds to North Atlantic.

Sea ice influences global climate by reflecting sunlight back into space. Because this solar energy is not absorbed into the ocean, temperatures nearer the poles remain cool. When sea ice melts, the surface area reflecting sunlight decreases, allowing more solar energy to be absorbed by the ocean, causing temperatures to rise. This creates a positive feedback loop. Warmer water temperatures delay ice growth in the autumn and winter, and the ice melts faster the following spring, exposing dark ocean waters for longer periods the following summer. Sea ice affects the movement of ocean waters. When sea ice forms, ocean salts are left behind. As the seawater gets saltier, its density increases, and it sinks. Surface water is pulled in to replace the sinking water, which in turn becomes cold and salty and sinks. This initiates deep-ocean currents driving the global ocean conveyor belt. Sea ice is an important element of the Arctic system. It provides an important habitat for biological activity, i.e. algae grows on the bottom of sea ice, forming the basis of the Arctic food web, and it plays a critical role in the life cycle of many marine mammals - seals and polar bears. Sea ice also serves a critical role in supporting Indigenous communities culture and survival. We present the annual sea ice extent in millions of Kilometers for the Arctic region. 11.1 Data Sea ice data was accessed from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/extent/ , with the data pulled from here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/extent/sea-ice/N/3/data.csv.

These events have significant impacts to coastal economies and communities. The Billion Dollar Disaster indicator provides information on the frequency and the total estimated costs of major weather and climate events that occur in the United States. This indicator compiles the annual number of weather and climate-related disasters across seven event types. Events are included if they are estimated to cause more than one billion U.S. dollars in direct losses. The cost estimates of these events are adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and are based on costs documented in several Federal and private-sector databases. We present the total annual number of disaster events for all regions. 19.1 Data Billion dollar disaster event frequency data are taken from NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/).
