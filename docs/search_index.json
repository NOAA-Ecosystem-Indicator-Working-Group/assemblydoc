[["sea-surface-temperature.html", "9 Sea Surface Temperature 9.1 Data 9.2 Methods", " 9 Sea Surface Temperature Sea surface temperature (SST) is defined as the temperature of the top few millimeters of the ocean. This temperature directly or indirectly impacts the rate of all physical, chemical, and most biological processes occurring in the ocean. SST is globally monitored by sensors on satellites, buoys, ships, ocean reference stations, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and other technologies. SST monitoring tells us how the ocean and atmosphere interact, as well as providing fundamental data on the global climate system. This information also aids us in weather prediction, i.e. identifying the onset of El Niño and La Niña cycles - multiyear shifts in atmospheric pressure and wind speeds. These shifts affect ocean circulation, global weather patterns, and marine ecosystems. SST anomalies have been linked to shifting marine resources. With warming temperatures, we observe the poleward movements of fish and other species. Temperature extremesboth ocean heatwaves and cold spellshave been linked to coral bleaching as well as fishery and aquaculture mortality. We present the annual average SST in all regions. 9.1 Data The SST product used for this analysis is the NOAA Coral Reef Watch CoralTemp v3.1 SST composite monthly accessed from CoastWatch (https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_sst.php). Great Lakes SST data were accessed from this link (https://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/glsea/glsea.html). The data are plotted in degrees Celsius. 9.2 Methods SST Data are currently compiled and analyzed by Melanie Abecassis from NESDIS (melanie.abecassis@noaa.gov). The NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) daily global 5km Sea Surface Temperature (SST) product, also known as CoralTemp, shows the nighttime ocean temperature measured at the surface. The CoralTemp SST data product was developed from two, related reanalysis (reprocessed) SST products and a near real-time SST product. Spanning January 1, 1985 to the present, the CoralTemp SST is one of the best and most internally consistent daily global 5km SST products available. Monthly composites were used for this analysis.
