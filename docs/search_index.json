This website is designed to document the data sources and methods used to create the indicators displayed on the site. 0.1 Definition of Indicators Ecosystem indicators are quantitative and/or qualitative measures of key components of the ecosystem. Marine ecosystems provide food, jobs, security, well-being, and other services to millions of people across the U.S. Yet, marine ecosystems and the people that rely on them are facing increasingly complex challenges. Tracking the status and trends of ocean and coastal ecosystems is critically important to understand how these ecosystems are changing and identify potential issues. 0.2 Indicator Criteria *Language as of December 2021 Ecosystem indicators are measures of the natural, social, and economic condition of the system. For example, scientists track the amount of revenue brought in by commercial fishing to measure how commercial fishing businesses are doing. Such indicators provide the ability to tell whether ecosystem attributes of interest are changing relative to management goals and objectives, and in some cases may provide the ability to predict how the system will change and assess related risk. TEST Criteria for choosing a new indicator or retiring an existing indicator on this site relate both to the data sourced to develop and measure the indicator, and the indicator properties. Indicators should meet the following Indicator Criteria: Indicators should be theoretically sound, reliably represent key ecosystem attributes and hold up to peer review. Indicators should have demonstrable importance to the ecosystem (e.g., keystone or structural architect species) and society (e.g charismatic or subsistence species)) Indicators should be relevant and understandable to management, to the public, and to policy makers Indicators should be responsive, showing sensitivity to and reacting predictably to environmental variability and/or management or policy actions. The direction of response should be theoretically- or empirically-expected. When possible, indicators should provide early warning of ecosystem change. Indicators should complement the indicators already served on the portal in ways such that they are not redundant Data used to develop indicators should meet the following Data Criteria: Data should be publicly available and be quantitative whenever possible. Qualitative information and expert opinion can provide context for quantitative indicators. Data should be specific, preferably directly measurable or observable. Data should be updated on a regular basis, preferably at least annually. Time-series should be long-term (&gt;10-years preferred) and likely to extend for the foreseeable future. Data collection that is cost effective for the program collecting the data is preferable to increase the likelihood the data set will continue to be collected and maintained over time. For nascent time series that have less than 10 years measurement, careful consideration of statistical treatment is required. In some cases reporting just the raw data is appropriate. For long-term climatological indices, recent short-term (e.g., last five years) trend analysis may not be appropriate. Some important data, such as those relating to corals, pH, oxygen etc. may be considered for use even if not regularly monitored. Careful consideration and explanation of the limits of such data must be documented and communicated on the NaMES web portal. Data should have appropriate and adequate spatial coverage. Ideally there will be data from each US Large Marine Ecosystem (LME), providing national coverage and the ability to synthesize the data across all regions. Some data (e.g., sea ice) are not readily available for all regions and in these cases full spatial coverage in all relevant areas is important. Some data (e.g., seabirds) do not cover the full region in relevant areas nor all species. Careful consideration and explanation of the limits of such data must be documented and communicated on the NaMES web portal. Normal ranges of spatial (e.g. patchiness) and temporal (e.g. diel, seasonal, annual, and decadal) variation for data should be considered to ascertain status and trends. Data should have sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to estimate measurement, process uncertainty, and detect significant change. "],["chlorophyll-a.html", "1 Chlorophyll-a 1.1 Data and Methods", " 1 Chlorophyll-a *This Indicator requires non-EIWG Contacts to update as of August 2021 At the base of most marine food webs are microscopic plants, called phytoplankton - which also produce nearly half of the Earths oxygen. One way we measure the amount of phytoplankton in the ocean is via a pigment that phytoplankton produce - chlorophyll a. Using ocean color sensors on satellites, we can measure the amount of chlorophyll a in surface waters. Environmental and oceanographic factors continuously influence the abundance, composition, spatial distribution, and productivity of phytoplankton. Tracking the amount of phytoplankton in the ocean gives us the status of the base of the food web, and how much food is available for other animals to grow. Changes in the amount of phytoplankton in the ocean are part of the natural seasonal cycle, but can also indicate an ecosystems response to a major external disturbance. 1.1 Data and Methods Chlorophyll a data were obtained from the NOAA Fisheries Coastal &amp; Oceanic Plankton Ecology, Production, &amp; Observations Database (https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/copepod/). Measurements of ocean chlorophyll concentration were combined from both the SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua ocean color datasets and binned at 0.5 x 0.5 degree latitude-longitude boxes, annual averages for each year calculated from the average of all monthly means in that year, and the annual mean was calculated as the average of all annual means.

By eating phytoplankton, and each other, zooplankton play a significant role in the transfer of materials and energy up the oceanic food web (e.g., fish, birds, marine mammals, humans.) Like phytoplankton, environmental and oceanographic factors continuously influence the abundance, composition and spatial distribution of zooplankton. These include the abundance and type of phytoplankton present in the water, as well as the waters temperature, salinity, oxygen, and pH. Zooplankton can rapidly react to changes in their environment. For this reason monitoring the status of zooplankton is essential for detecting changes in, and evaluating the status of ocean ecosystems. We present the annual average total biovolume of zooplankton in the Alaska, California Current, Gulf of Mexico and Northeast regions. 2.1 Data Zooplankton data for each region were obtained from the NOAA Fisheries Coastal &amp; Oceanic Plankton Ecology, Production, &amp; Observations Database, an integrated data set of quality-controlled, globally distributed plankton biomass and abundance data with common biomass units and served in a common electronic format with supporting documentation and access software which can be found at https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/copepod/about/about-copepod.html 2.2 Methods Data are compiled and analyzed by the COPEPOD database manager Todd OBrien.

Examples include anchovies, sardines, shad, menhaden and the fish that feed on them Small pelagic species are often important to fisheries and serve as forage for commercially and recreationally important fish, as well as other ecosystem species (e.g. seabirds and marine mammals).

Caught by recreational and commercial fisheries, fish support significant parts of coastal economies, and can play an important cultural role in many regions. To understand the health of fish populations - as well as their abundance and distribution, we regularly assess fish stocks - stock assessments. Assessments let us know if a stock is experiencing overfishing or if it is overfished i.e. how much catch is sustainable while maintaining a healthy stock. And, if a stock becomes depleted, stock assessments can help determine what steps may be taken to rebuild it to sustainable levels. Understanding stock assessments helps measure how well were managing and recovering fish stocks over time. We present the number of overfished stocks by year in all regions. 6.1 Data Data are obtained from the NOAA Fisheries Fishery Stock Status website https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/population-assessments/fishery-stock-status-updates.

The ESA aims to conserve these species and the ecosystems they depend on. Under the ESA, a species is considered endangered if it is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, or threatened if it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range See a species directory of all the threatened and endangered marine species under NOAA Fisheries jurisdiction, including marine mammals. Under the ESA, a species must be listed if it is threatened or endangered because of any of the following 5 factors: Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; Over-utilization of the species for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; Disease or predation; Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; and Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. The ESA requires that listing determinations be based solely on the best scientific and commercial information available; economic impacts are not considered in making species listing determinations and are prohibited under the ESA. There are two ways by which a species may come to be listed (or delisted) under the ESA: NOAA Fisheries receives a petition from a person or organization requesting that NOAA lists a species as threatened or endangered, reclassify a species, or delist a species. NOAA Fisheries voluntarily chooses to examine the status of a species by initiating a status review of a species. 7.2 MMPA Description of Marine Mammal Strategic and Depleted Stocks (MMPA): A stock is defined by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), as a group of marine mammals of the same species or smaller taxa in a common spatial arrangement, that interbreed when mature. See a list of the marine mammal stocks NOAA protects under the MMPA. A strategic stock is defined by the MMPA as a marine mammal stock For which the level of direct human-caused mortality exceeds the potential biological removal level or PBR (defined by the MMPA as the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population); Which, based on the best available scientific information, is declining and is likely to be listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) within the foreseeable future; or Which is listed as a threatened or endangered species under the ESA, or is designated as depleted under the MMPA. A depleted stock is defined by the MMPA as any case in which The Secretary of Commerce, after consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and the Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals established under MMPA title II, determines that a species or population stock is below its optimum sustainable population; A State, to which authority for the conservation and management of a species or population stock is transferred under section 109, determines that such species or stock is below its optimum sustainable population; or A species or population stock is listed as an endangered species or a threatened species under the ESA. 7.2.1 Data Data for the Southeast and Gulf of Mexico regions are combined. Data are summarized using NOAAs PR-SIS Data Portal (which is not public-facing), but all information displayed can be found on the NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal Stock Assessments Page for strategic and depleted marine mammal stocks, and on the NOAA Fisheries Threatened and Endangered Species Directory Page for threatened and endangered marine mammals.

"],["marine-species-distribution.html", "8 Marine Species Distribution 8.1 Data 8.2 Methods", " 8 Marine Species Distribution The geographic location where a species is found, known as that species distribution, is a fundamental piece of information. Some species naturally move from location to location throughout the year, following seasons, food, or other factors. However, as climate change causes ocean waters to warm, populations of many species are moving towards the poles (northward in the northern hemisphere) or deeper towards cooler waters, allowing them to track their preferred temperature. Changes in a species distribution are not always due to individual animals following a preferred temperature, but could also be due to reduced survival of individuals in the warming areas. Understanding where and how fast marine species are moving is important to coastal communities as these changing distributions can affect the species available for fishing, recreation, and cultural practices. Marine species distributions are also good indicators of a warming ocean as they largely follow the species preferred temperature, can react quickly to ocean changes, and have been measured for many years, allowing us to see changes over time. 8.1 Data The marine species distribution data shown here is the average centroid, or mean location (as either latitude or depth) of the species weighted by biomass, of a large number of species from a region. These centroids are calculated by Ocean Adapt using data gathered by NOAAs National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and other agencies.

Sea Surface Temperature is globally monitored by sensors on satellites, buoys, ships, ocean reference stations, AUVs and other technologies. Sea Surface Temperature monitoring tells us how the ocean and atmosphere interact, as well as providing fundamental data on the global climate system. This information also aids us in weather prediction i.e. identifying the onset of El Niño and La Niña cycles - multiyear shifts in atmospheric pressure and wind speeds. These shifts affect ocean circulation, global weather patterns, and marine ecosystems. Sea Surface Temperature anomalies have been linked to shifting marine resources.

Other forces affecting sea levels include temperature, wind, ocean currents, tides, and other similar processes. With 40 percent of Americans living in densely populated coastal areas, having a clear understanding of sea level trends is critical to societal and economic well being. Measuring and predicting sea levels, tides and storm surge are important for determining coastal boundaries, ensuring safe shipping, emergency preparedness, and other aspects of the well-being of coastal communities. 10.1 Data and Methods Sea level data presented here are measurements of relative sea level, water height as compared to nearby land level, from NOAA tide gauges that have &gt;20 years of hourly data served through NOAAs Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) Tides and Currents website. The data are compiled by Billy Sweet at william.sweet@noaa.gov "],["sea-ice.html", "11 Sea Ice 11.1 Data 11.2 Methods", " 11 Sea Ice Unlike icebergs, glaciers, ice sheets, and ice shelves, which originate on land, sea ice forms, expands, and melts in the ocean. Sea ice influences global climate by reflecting sunlight back into space. Because this solar energy is not absorbed into the ocean, temperatures nearer the poles remain cool. When sea ice melts, the surface area reflecting sunlight decreases, allowing more solar energy to be absorbed by the ocean, causing temperatures to rise. This creates a positive feedback loop. Warmer water temperatures delay ice growth in the autumn and winter, and the ice melts faster the following spring, exposing dark ocean waters for longer periods the following summer. Sea ice affects the movement of ocean waters. When sea ice forms, ocean salts are left behind. As the seawater gets saltier, its density increases, and it sinks. Surface water is pulled in to replace the sinking water, which in turn becomes cold and salty and sinks. This initiates deep-ocean currents driving the global ocean conveyor belt. Sea ice is an important element of the Arctic system. It provides an important habitat for biological activity, i.e. algae grows on the bottom of sea ice, forming the basis of the Arctic food web, and it plays a critical role in the life cycle of many marine mammals - seals and polar bears. Sea ice also serves a critical role in supporting Indigenous communities culture and survival. We present the annual sea ice extent in millions of Kilometers for the Arctic region. 11.1 Data Sea ice data was accessed from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/extent/ , with the data pulled from here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/extent/sea-ice/N/3/data.csv. The data are plotted in units of million square km. 11.2 Methods To download the current sea ice data, you can either: Copy/paste the following url into your web browser: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/extent/sea-ice/N/3/data.csv or Use the following R code to download the data and import it into your RStudio environment url &lt;-&quot;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/extent/sea-ice/N/3/data.csv&quot; # Specify destination where file should be saved destfile &lt;- &quot;C:/Users/ ...

These indices identify naturally occurring variability of the climate, which at this time results in much larger regional changes in conditions than systemic global warming. Six major climate indicators presented here are the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (Nino4 indexENSO), Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), East-Pacific-North Pacific teleconnection pattern (EP-NP)North Pacific Index (NPI), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Though each of these broadscale climate indicators are based within specific ocean regions and are measured across different time scales, all impact people and ecosystems across the globe and each of the indicators presented here. Interactions between the ocean and atmosphere alters weather around the world and can result in severe storms or mild weather, drought or flooding. Beyond just influencing the weather and ocean conditions, these changes can produce secondary results that influence food supplies and prices, forest fires and flooding, and create additional economic and political consequences. 12.1 ENSO ENSO Data can be downloaded directly from NOAA PSL at this link: https://psl.noaa.gov/data/timeseries/monthly/NINO4/ 12.2 MEI MEI Data can be downloaded directly from NOAA PSL at this link: https://psl.noaa.gov/enso/mei/ 12.3 PDO PDO Data can be downloaded directly from NCDC at this link: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/pdo/data.csv 12.4 EPNP NOAA EPNP Data is hosted by Columbia University at this link: https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP/.CPC/.Indices/.NHTI/EPNP/T+exch+table-+text+text+skipanyNaN+-table+.html 12.5 NAO NAO Data can be downloaded directly from NCDC at this link: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/nao/data.csv 12.6 AMO AMO Data can be downloaded directly from NOAA PSL at this link: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/timeseries/AMO/ Questions can be directed to willem.klajbor@noaa.gov or scott.cross@noaa.gov "],["coastal-population.html", "13 Coastal Population 13.1 Data 13.2 Methods", " 13 Coastal Population While marine ecosystems are important for people all across the country, they are essential for people living in coastal communities. The population density of coastal counties is over six times greater than inland counties. In the U.S. coastal counties make up less than 10 percent of the total land area (not including Alaska), but account for 39 percent of the total population. From 1970 to 2010, the population of these counties increased by almost 40% and are projected to increase by over 10 million people or 8+% into the 2020s. The population density of an area is an important factor for economic planning, emergency preparedness, understanding environmental impacts, resource demand, and many other reasons. Thus, this indicator is important to track. We present the number of residents within all regions. 13.1 Data Coastal population data was retrieved from the Census Bureaus county population totals, filtered to present coastal counties using the Census Bureaus list of coastal counties within each state.

It does not include sport or subsistence (to feed themselves) fishermen or for-hire sector, which earns its revenue from selling recreational fishing trips to saltwater anglers. Data on those fisheries are presented under the recreational landings and angler trips indicator. Commercial landings make up a major part of coastal economies. U.S. commercial fisheries are among the worlds largest and most sustainable; producing seafood, fish meal, vitamin supplements, and a host of other products for both domestic and international consumers. The weight (tonnage), and revenue from the sale of commercial landings provides data on the ability of marine ecosystems to continue to supply these important products. 16.1 Data Commercial landings and gross revenue were downloaded from the National Marine Fisheries Services annual commercial fisheries landings query tool which can be found at https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200::::::.

These events have significant impacts to coastal economies and communities. The Billion Dollar Disaster indicator provides information on the frequency and the total estimated costs of major weather and climate events that occur in the United States. This indicator compiles the annual number of weather and climate-related disasters across seven event types. Events are included if they are estimated to cause more than one billion U.S. dollars in direct losses. The cost estimates of these events are adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and are based on costs documented in several Federal and private-sector databases. We present the total annual number of disaster events for all regions. 19.1 Data Billion dollar disaster event frequency data are taken from NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/). The number of disasters within each region were summed for every year of available data.

Unsafe water and air quality may have significant impacts on human health, local economies, and the ecosystem. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) supports coastal states, counties and and tribes in monitoring beach water quality, and notifying the public when beaches must be closed. Beach water quality is determined by the concentration of bacteria in the water (either Enterococcus sp.or Escherichia coli). The information presented is from states, counties, and tribes that submit data to the EPA Beach Program reporting database. Not all US beach closures are captured in this database. We present a summary of known EPA Beach Program closure days by year for Alaska, California Current, Gulf of Mexico, Northeast, Hawaiian Islands, and the Southeast regions. 20.1 Data Data obtained from the EPA BEACON website have been provided to EPA by the coastal and Great Lakes states, tribes and territories that receive grants under the BEACH Act.
